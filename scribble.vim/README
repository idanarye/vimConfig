Scribble allows for mixing of racket code with plain text using an
at-expression syntax.

Use this to get some kind of sanity to your scribble-in-vim sessions!

** USE  https://github.com/wlangstroth/vim-racket --
** Use racket.vim from this package (and probably the rest of the package)
** Don't use vimscript #3755 -- vim-racket is much more fulfilling!

DO look at vimscript #3757 -- it too is cheap and cheerful -- but with potential, I hope

Same comments apply as to (my now deprecated) racket.vim:
  * high degree of both cheapness and cheerfulness
  * works-for-me -- and I'll share it in this state because
  * ... it gets me off the ground with this
