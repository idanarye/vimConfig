As everyone knows, the most complex codes were composed of a mass of different kinds of parentheses. This plugin will help you read these codes by showing different levels of parentheses in different colors. 

See the effect here : http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Script:4176

What is improved ? 
* smoother and faster. (linear time complexity) 
* now you can design your own parentheses  such as 'begin' and 'end' . (with the autocmd for different type of file, you can design  what kinds of parentheses to use for different filetypes. ) 
* no limit of parentheses levels. 
* the code is shorter and easier to be read now. (shorter than 100 lines) 
* separately edit guifgs and ctermfgs (the colors used to highlight)
