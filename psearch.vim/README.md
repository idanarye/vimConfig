## PSearch.vim

**v0.1.0**


### Overview

This plugin shows a preview of all the lines where your search
pattern matches in the current file. 

![Screenshot](/extra/screenshot.png "A view of the plugin at work")  

To open the preview window use the `PSearch` command. As you start typing into
the special command line you'll see the preview window updating automatically.

Note that you are allowed to use any pattern that would work with the `/` and
`?` vim commands.

Below there is list of all the mappings you can use to interact with the window:

* `UP`, `CTRL+K`: move up in the list.
* `DOWN`, `CTRL+J`: move down in the list.
* `RETURN`, `CTRL+G`: go to the selected match.
* `ESC`, `CTRL+C`: close the matches list.
